    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        
        //We need to add the same code we used in project 16 to make the text view adjust its content and scroll insets when the keyboard appears and disappears.
        //We can ask to be told when the keyboard state changes by using a new class called NotificationCenter. Behind the scenes, iOS is constantly sending out notifications when things happen – keyboard changing, application moving to the background, as well as any custom events that applications post. We can add ourselves as an observer for certain notifications and a method we name will be called when the notification occurs, and will even be passed any useful information.
        //When working with the keyboard, the notifications we care about are UIKeyboardWillHide and UIKeyboardWillChangeFrame. The first will be sent when the keyboard has finished hiding, and the second will be shown when any keyboard state change happens – including showing and hiding, but also orientation, QuickType and more.
        //It might sound like we don't need UIKeyboardWillHide if we have UIKeyboardWillChangeFrame, but in my testing just using UIKeyboardWillChangeFrame isn't enough to catch a hardware keyboard being connected. Now, that's an extremely rare case, but we might as well be sure!
        //To register ourselves as an observer for a notification, we get a reference to the default notification center. We then use the addObserver() method, which takes four parameters: the object that should receive notifications (it's self), the method that should be called, the notification we want to receive, and the object we want to watch. We're going to pass nil to the last parameter, meaning "we don't care who sends the notification."
        let notificationCenter = NotificationCenter.default
        notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(adjustForKeyboard), name: Notification.Name.UIKeyboardWillHide, object: nil)
        notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(adjustForKeyboard), name: Notification.Name.UIKeyboardWillChangeFrame, object: nil)
        
        
        
//        notification that will tell us when the application will stop being active – i.e., when our app has been backgrounded or the user has switched to multitasking mode
        notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(saveSecretMsg), name: Notification.Name.UIApplicationWillResignActive, object: nil)
        
        title = "Nothing to see here"
        
    }
    
    @objc func adjustForKeyboard(notification: Notification) {
        //The adjustForKeyboard() method is complicated, but that's because it has quite a bit of work to do. First, it will receive a parameter that is of type Notification. This will include the name of the notification as well as a Dictionary containing notification-specific information called userInfo.
        let userInfo = notification.userInfo!
        
        
        //When working with keyboards, the dictionary will contain a key called UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey telling us the frame of the keyboard after it has finished animating. This will be of type NSValue, which in turn is of type CGRect. The CGRect struct holds both a CGPoint and a CGSize, so it can be used to describe a rectangle
        //One of the quirks of Objective-C was that arrays and dictionaries couldn't contain structures like CGRect, so Apple had a special class called NSValue that acted as a wrapper around structures so they could be put into dictionaries and arrays. That's what's happening here: we're getting an NSValue object, but we know it contains a CGRect inside so we use its cgRectValue property to read that value.
        let keyboardScreenEndFrame = (userInfo[UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as! NSValue).cgRectValue
         //Once we finally pull out the correct frame of the keyboard, we need to convert the rectangle to our view's co-ordinates. This is because rotation isn't factored into the frame, so if the user is in landscape we'll have the width and height flipped – using the convert() method will fix that.
        let keyboardViewEndFrame = view.convert(keyboardScreenEndFrame, from: view.window)
