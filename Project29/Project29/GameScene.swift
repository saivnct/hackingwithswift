For the height, it can be anything between 300 and 600 points high; for the width, I want to make sure it divides evenly into 40 so that our window-drawing code is simple, so we'll generate a random number between 2 and 4 then multiply that by 40 to give us buildings that are 80, 120 or 160 points wide.

        //SpriteKit has a super-stylish and built-in way of letting you transition between scenes. This means you can have one scene for your menu, one for your options, one for your game, and so on, then transition between them as if they were view controllers in a navigation controller.
        //To transition from one scene to another, you first create the scene, then create a transition using the list available from SKTransition, then finally use the presentScene() method of our scene's view, passing in the new scene and the transition you created

But when we create the new game scene we also need to do something very important: we need to update the view controller's currentGame property and set the new scene's viewController property so they can talk to each other once the change has happened.
        //We also need to call the changePlayer() method when a player is destroyed. We haven't written this method yet, but it transfers control of the game to the other player, then calls the activatePlayer() method on the game view controller so that the game controls are re-shown.
